; A file system is an immutable set of files in a single directory.
; File names are modeled as numbers.
;
; Programs operate on a file system by passing an inode-op? to execute,
; which returns a new file system reflecting the updated state.
;
; File systems also control the compilation of programs to inode-ops.
; Passing a list of syscalls to crack returns a list of inode-ops
; corresponding to that program.
;
; Finally, a file system dictates whether two inode-op?s can be reordered
; with each other, according to the reorder? procedure.
